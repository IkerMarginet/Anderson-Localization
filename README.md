## 📘 Overview

This repository presents a structured and in-depth study of *Anderson localization* in disordered quantum systems. The work is based on a theoretical and numerical research project conducted as part of my undergraduate thesis. It aims to be a reference for students and researchers interested in the mathematical formalism and physical consequences of localization phenomena in low-dimensional systems.

Key theoretical concepts are supported by rigorous derivations, diagrammatic visualizations, and (in progress) numerical simulations using Python.
